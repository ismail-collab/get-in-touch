# Get in Touch

Welcome to my personal "Get in Touch" page repository. This is a simple, yet effective web space crafted to connect and display my professional social networks in one centralized location. 

## Overview

The aim of this repository is to maintain the source code for a static webpage that serves as a hub for my professional online presence. Whether you're a potential employer, a colleague, or someone interested in my work, this page makes it easy for you to connect with me across various professional platforms.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the source code to understand more about the construction of a personal profile page. If you'd like to create something similar for your own use, you can clone the repository and modify the HTML and CSS files as needed.
